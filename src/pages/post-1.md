This paper presents the expected sensitivity to the neutrino oscillation parameters of the Hyper-Kamiokande long-baseline program. The Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, currently under construction in Japan, will measure the oscillations of accelerator-produced neutrinos with thousands of selected events per sample: this corresponds to an increase of statistics of a factor 25 to 100 with respect to recent results from the currently-running long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan, T2K. In the most favorable scenario we will achieve the discovery of ChargeParity (CP) violation in neutrino oscillation at 5σ C.L. in less than three years. With 10 years of data-taking, and assuming a neutrino : antineutrino beam running ratio of 1:3, a CP violation discovery at 5σ C.L. is possible for more than 60% of the actual values of the CP-violating phase, δCP. Moreover, we will measure δCP with a precision ranging from 20◦, in the case of maximal CP violation, to 6◦, in the case of CP conservation. We aim to achieve a 0.5% resolution on the ∆ m232 parameter, and a resolution between 3% and 0.5% on the sin2 θ23 parameter, depending on its true value. These results are obtained by extending the analysis methods of T2K with dedicated tuning to take into account the Hyper-Kamiokande design: the larger far detector, the more powerful beam, the upgraded near detector ND280, and the planned additional Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector.
