Jonathan Hickman reimagines the Ultimate Universe with a bold new direction. Following a cataclysmic event orchestrated by the Maker, the familiar heroes have been erased, leaving Peter Parker to forge his own path. With Iron Lad (Tony Stark) working behind the scenes and a Spider-powered Peter dealing with responsibilities both new and familiar, Hickman crafts a fresh Spider-Man story that honors the character's legacy while charting unexplored territory.
