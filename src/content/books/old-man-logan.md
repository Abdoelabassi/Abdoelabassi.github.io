Millar and McNiven deliver a haunting vision of a world transformed by villainy and conquest. Old Man Logan is a character study of the aging X-Men member forced back into action, facing the consequences of a past he tried to escape. The narrative is intimate despite its epic scope, exploring themes of guilt, responsibility, and whether redemption is possible for those who have failed. McNiven's artwork is breathtaking, capturing both the desolate landscape and the raw emotion of a legendary warrior confronting his own mortality.
