Morrison and McKean's collaboration is a disturbing descent into psychological chaos. Arkham Asylum reads as much like a fever dream as a coherent narrative, with McKean's experimental artwork perfectly complementing Morrison's fractured storytelling. The book explores the nature of madness through encounters with Batman's rogues gallery, each encounter peeling back another layer of psychological horror. It's a challenging, artistic work that refuses easy answers, treating the asylum as a character itself—a living, breathing entity of chaos. An absolute masterpiece of psychological comics.
