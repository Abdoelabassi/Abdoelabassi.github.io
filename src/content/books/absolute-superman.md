In this bold reimagining of DC's Absolute Universe, Jason Aaron presents Superman without his typical support systems and connections to his past. With Rafa Sandoval's stunning artwork, this series explores what it means to be heroic when stripped of technology, family bonds, and earthly ties. It's a character-driven space epic that treats Superman's mythology as both a playground and laboratory for fresh ideas.
