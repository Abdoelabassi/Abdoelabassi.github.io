Premium ergonomic office chair in excellent condition. Used in a smoke-free home office environment. All adjustments work smoothly, lumbar support is fully functional, and the mesh material is clean with minimal wear. Perfect for long work sessions. Still has 5 years remaining on the manufacturer warranty. Local delivery available for additional fee.
